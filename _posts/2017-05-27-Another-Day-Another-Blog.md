I have never really thought about blogging too much. I mean I put so much garbage out in the world between twitter, facebook, livejournal (im old), etc. Do I really need another place for a voice? Well maybe I should start with my Agreement to myself and start out with what this blog will not be.

# what this blog is not

1. a place for me to complain about any one individual
2. a place to generate hate, negativity, or generally being a shit.
3. difficult to maintain. No fancy pages, images, or requirements that involve me learning css. I just wont do it.
4. self promotion or marketing
5. accessibility should be a priority for anyone to read, including myself.
6. I will not learn css

# what this blog is

1. articles about what I've learned; technology, about myself, about the world around me
2. being a woman in technology
3. contains zero regard for potentially harming my own personal branding
5. traveling info and updates
6. there will be stuff about food
7. void of css
