title: Late Night Treadmill Musings

Current Pace: 16:00 Miles

Yes, I am typing while walking. That is a thing. Well, in San Francisco that is a thing. A treadmill desk at home. Yes. Lets move on.

I'm getting ready to start a new job next week. I'm excited, scared..terrified actually, empowered, confident, imposter syndrome ridden....well borderline incapacitated with emotion over it. I left my job at Cisco/OpenDNS earlier this month. There wasn't any really real reason, but maybe just a bunch of reasons.

Working With the Best
===
Working for OpenDNS was one of the best experiences in the last 20 years in technology. Working there taught me to be passionate not just about what I am building but what the entire company is building, together. After leaving Facebook, it was so refreshing to work for a company that was genuinely human. Sure we had free snacks, good software engineers, and a compelling problem to solve. But the best asset they had, was the culture. Townhalls were packed, passionate, and you truly believed in what you were doing. The weekend couldn't end soon enough. The culture was intoxicating and you knew what you were building not only made a positive impact on peoples lives, but you had the support to experiment and do anything you wanted.

A mantra for OpenDNS was "Don't Be An Asshole" It was a speech given at the Tahoe retreat, at events, and generally it is expected. All of us had the capacity to be an asshole, but this was something you were just expected to know and a way you were expected to behave. But my last year, it was getting harder and harder to not be one to myself.

Don't Be An Asshole
===
While I could sit here and talk about all the times OpenDNS failed me, and there were only a few times, or speak about the interactions I had that were less than great, it accomplishes nothing. My reaction is what destroyed the growth I would potentially have. And my learned reactions, go back much farther than Cisco/OpenDNS.

My reaction to bad interactions is what has been a constant detriment to me in my career. Women today are built tougher, taught better, and learned better coping skills. Im still learning, and while I can do better, I can at least tell you what not to do.

Almost 20 years ago, I was working on porting Kerberos to SSH. I did this at the now defunct Verio. We were still using 'telnet' for administrative functions. It was going against every fiber of who I was. So I spent almost a year working with a tiger team to internally port the work. While they were fine with me testing it, working on it, and contributing code to the project, my leader wouldn't deploy it. This is after months of everything I was doing being torn a part and having to prove beyond a doubt of my testing results. It wasn't after a year and a security event that they deployed my release. Not me, my sexual harassing boss deployed it. My name was never mentioned or on it. My response, I was quietly thankful I no longer had to telnet to another server.

While at Verio, I reported this manager was exposing himself to me and other women. I reported him, once, and they retaliated the very next day.  I was written up for being 20 minutes late to my salary job.  I called my mother, crying, to tell her that I had been written up. I told her everything that had happened. She told me to just shut up and do my job. They aren't paying me to make friends or have a party. Im not there to care about who likes me or who is being mean. She was a working single mom from the age of Mad Men. A world where they won't believe you so just shut up and be thankful you have a job. This man exposed himself for three more years. I brought it up twice in that time and since I couldn't produce evidence, they didn't take action. Three years he would continue to harass women until he was let go. But before it was all over, I had grown tired of fighting for recognition, basic respect, and the ability to come to work without having to see a man's penis. My response, become a technical project manager. I get to keep my salary, I would no longer get harassed and I can enjoy my day again. I had a chance to move to Virginia to work and I took it immediately. It would take me 50 blog posts to cover my career of dealing with male dominance and harassment. My response however, was always the same. Shut up and do my work. Deal with it, or change, after all they let you show up.

I struggled with Imposter Syndrome constantly. It stopped me from developing and working with computers all together. It became exhausting between fighting the harassment, keeping up technically, and keeping my own passion for technology under control. When you are made to feel like you aren't good enough, smart enough, or capable; battling depression is the only thing thats left. There were no other women on my team for support, and this is mostly true today. When you are struggling with this, you struggle with it alone.

I never recognized that my response to these situations was ultimately hurting me. I have learned many coping skills. I was a professional at acting dumb to disarm men. If I acted like I simply didn't know, I didn't have to argue about why I was right. And if I was wrong, the hell that is mansplaining is a sour pill I wouldn't have to take. Taking blame was another coping mechanism. Especially during decision making time. What an amazing way to get a group to move forward. I take the blame and add a dash of self-defeating words and winning! Except, I couldn't figure out why I was never getting recognized for my hard work or respected. hmm.

In this story, we are now back at OpenDNS. I'm leading a team of amazing engineers. I'm smiling every day and loving every minute. And this is the moment where I become the asshole. (In a meeting) Engineer: 'Jenn, you can code this yourself' Me: 'Shh.. don't tell people that'.  This is the moment when I realized what was happening. I was acting in fear again, by default.

Current Pace: 15:23 minute mile

Ok, Be an Asshole

Like every other company, they make the choice of aptitude over attitude. In a sea of engineers, really good ones are few and far between. So a company will coach, provide support, to the Asshole. They do this in hopes of making this person's behavior match their technical aptitude. One day, companies will grow the technical aptitude instead. Anyways, I was struggling with one of these individuals. He was a bully. Now there won't be any sensational explosive story here. At the end of the day, this person was one of the best and worst people I have ever worked with. The point here is, this person wasn't going anywhere and either was his onslaught of micro-aggressions.

After going into that space again of, "What am I even doing here with these people, I don't belong here" self-doubt parade, I decided I wasn't going to just deal with it anymore. I changed direction and went into another role. Sound familiar? The only thing that ended up happening was me drowning in depression and a deep sea of self-doubt. To save us paragraphs of details, I came out of it.

An opportunity came up. I would get to face the same aggression, but this time something amazing happened. I was supported. My new leadership apologized and told me it was going to be addressed. Oh Sunny Day! I was so happy. I thanked them for taking action. I felt empowered, I felt... compelled to push and make change again. I felt.. safe. Safety enables people to accelerate productivity and creativity. I was ready. I felt awake and energized to contribute. I no longer felt like I was just in a corner, but that I could "lean in". I never got an apology from the aggressor, but thats ok because I had support. Until it happened again.

The leadership that was supporting me was new. For whatever reason, he realized that supporting me wasn't the winning ticket. I was told this person was just "having a bad day" and that people can have those. Was I even aware what he was building? I just lost it. Finally, I am going to be the asshole. I spoke up and said "NO. I will NEVER accept aptitude over attitude. Never." I got the same responses to my meltdown I have been hearing for 20 years. Lets list them out, see if they sound familiar to you.

1. "I talked with his reports, they love working for him"
2. "The common denominator is you"
3. "He's under a lot of stress" (and these are the amazing reasons why)
4. "Well lets find some work for you where you don't have to talk to him"

[Susan Fowler's blog](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber) post about being a Female Engineer at Uber changed me. It stirred up so much for me. I felt like, it wasn't just me. I didn't feel alone anymore. I cried. I felt so much compassion for her and for myself, it shook my core. Her story is not mine and it's not any more or less than my own. What it did do was not only take me out of this downward spiral of self-doubt, but empower me to only accept the best behavior from people and companies.

Susan Fowler is getting a similar response now; "no else is complaining". We as women have to start writing about this. We have to write the stories that happen to us, and make them public. Taking the risk of telling your story helps grow awareness of the work that still needs to be done.

I had several opportunities at my door at this time. A big opportunity was internal and two were external. But regardless, the listed out response above tasted like battery acid and made my decision for me.

Whether I had a job lined up or not, was I going to tolerate this? I was already not providing impact and loosing passion and further more, I deserved better. So I quit.

Don't Be An Asshole, Be Amazing

Engineering Safety is a passion of mine. It is only recently that I truly understand why it's *my* passion. I have spent so much time ensuring teams understand Engineering Safety, Excellence and Culture. But it was from the perspective of how it is for someone else or the team. Never for myself. So my commitment to myself is:

 1. never tolerate, mask, or own someone else's shitty behavior.
 2. a company with a culture that promotes aptitude over attitude is not where my story will be written.
 3. do what you love and don't be afraid to fail. Only I can choose my response to the failure.
